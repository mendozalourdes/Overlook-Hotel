## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html) of this group project that was made for Module  1 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build create an hotel booking website using Javascript, HTML, SCSS, Webpack with data from an API.  

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Use OOP to drive the design of the application and code. 
2. Work with an API to send and receive data. 
3. Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Features
* A website that allows users to log into their account, view their past and future hotel stays, and book new rooms.

## Instructions for Running Project
1. This project fetches data from an API so you will need to begin by cloning down the API and running it.
2. Clone the API by running git clone git@github.com: github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api
3. CD into that directory, run npm install and then npm start. You should see “What's cookin-starter-kit API is now running on http://localhost:3001 !”
4. Open a NEW terminal tab and cd somewhere outside of the API repo you just cloned. Do not close the tab that is running the API.
5. Clone a copy of this repo to your machine by running git clone git@github.com:clairefields15/whats-cookin.git
6. CD into the directory
7. Run npm install
8. Run npm start
9. A link will appear in the terminal similar to http://localhost:8080/ (you might see 8081). Open that link in your browser.
